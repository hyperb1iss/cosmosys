StarForge uses TOML for configuration. Here's a sample `starforge.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "YourAwesomeProject"
version = "0.1.0"

[release]
steps = ["version_update", "run_tests", "build", "publish"]

[color_scheme]
name = "neon"

[git]
main_branch = "main"
```

## 🎨 Color Schemes

StarForge comes with several predefined color schemes:

- `default`: A balanced, easy-on-the-eyes scheme
- `neon`: Bright and vibrant for those who like to live dangerously
- `monochrome`: For the minimalists out there

You can also define your own color schemes in the configuration file!
